    Fox
    by ALICE OSWALD

    I heard a cough
    as if a thief was there
    outside my sleep
    a sharp intake of air
    
    a fox in her fox-fur
    stepping across
    the grass in her black gloves
    barked at my house
    
    just so abrupt and odd
    the way she went
    hungrily asking
    in the heart's thick accent
    
    in such serious sleepless
    trespass she came
    a woman with a man's voice
    but no name
    
    as if to say: it's midnight
    and my life
    is laid beneath my children
    like gold leaf</p>
